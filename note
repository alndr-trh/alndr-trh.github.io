1) apache and utils is installed
2) systemctl start httpd to start apache server, it will run on http://localhost/
3) site root in /srv/http
4) some problems maybe with ip parser while trying to connect to server, temporary comment it out in sway bar script
5) ALNDR_TRH home/alndr_trh folder chmodded to 701 from 700 to allow others to execute. GET IT BACK AFTER
